# pomodo-rs

> A terminal based pomodoro timer

## Prerequisites

Up-to-date rust and cargo installation

## Installation

Clone repository and run `cargo build`

For comfort I would recommend adding an alias for it to your source via `alias pomodors=<path-to-project>/target/debug/pomodors`

## Usage

Run `cargo run -- -h` (or with the previous step `pomodors -h`).

For default settings (30 min work, 5 min break) just run the program
